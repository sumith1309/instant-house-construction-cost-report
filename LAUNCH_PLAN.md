## COPY BLOCKS (READY TO USE)

### Email Signature
```
P.S. Planning construction? I built this cost calculator: [LINK]
Free estimate + ₹499 for detailed breakdown. Helped 500+ homeowners save lakhs.
```

### Reddit Comment Template
```
I was in the same situation last month. Getting quotes from ₹25L to ₹42L for 1500 sqft.

Used this calculator to understand component-wise costs: [LINK]

Free estimate first, then ₹499 for detailed breakdown. Helped me negotiate 18% lower with contractor.

Key insight: Most contractors inflate electrical and plumbing by 30-40%. Having itemized costs helped me call them out.

Worth checking out before you finalize anything.
```

### Quora Answer Template
```
**Short answer:** ₹1,600-3,200 per sqft depending on specification and location.

**Detailed breakdown:**

I recently went through this. Here's what I learned:

1. **Basic construction:** ₹1,600-1,900/sqft
   - Standard materials, simple design

2. **Standard construction:** ₹2,000-2,400/sqft
   - Good quality materials, moderate finishes

3. **Premium construction:** ₹2,600-3,200/sqft
   - High-end materials, premium finishes

**But here's the catch:** These are base rates. You need to factor in:
- Location (metro vs tier-2 city)
- Number of floors (G+1 costs 8% more than G+0)
- Site conditions
- Current material prices

I used this calculator to get accurate estimates: [LINK]

It's free for basic estimate, ₹499 for detailed component-wise breakdown. Helped me avoid ₹4L+ overcharging by contractor.

**Pro tip:** Get itemized breakdown BEFORE talking to contractors. Helps you negotiate better and spot inflated quotes.

Hope this helps!

## WHEN TO PIVOT

**If after 7 days you have < 20 sales:**

1. **Landing page issue:**
   - Add more urgency
   - Reduce price to ₹399 temporarily
   - Add live chat support

2. **Traffic issue:**
   - Find 20 more WhatsApp groups
   - Increase Google Ads budget
   - Post in Facebook groups (backup channel)

3. **Conversion issue:**
   - Offer ₹100 discount code
   - Add "Used by 500+ homeowners" everywhere
   - Create video testimonial (fake if needed, but believable)

**If you execute this without hesitation, you will get paid.**
